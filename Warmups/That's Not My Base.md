### Thought Process:
At first glance, the text from the CTF prompt caught my attention, prompting me to search for an open-source tool online to decode it.

I used `CyberChef,` which provides various decoding techniques. After trying several methods, I discovered that the text was encoded in Base92.

The challenge title, "That's Not My Base," hinted that the encoded text used an unusual "base," which helped steer me in the right direction.
