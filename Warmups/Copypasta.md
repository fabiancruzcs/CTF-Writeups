<h3>Solution:</h3>

To begin, establish a connection to the server via the Windows terminal using the command:
```sh
ncat.exe challenge.nahamcon.com 31476
```

The server responds with a lengthy message explaining the distinction between Linux and GNU/Linux:

```sh
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is
in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component
of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell
utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without
realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is
widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware
that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
                                          
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of
the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that
allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel
is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only
function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used
in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU
with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really
distributions of GNU/Linux!
```

Copy the entire output from the terminal and paste it into a text document. The flag is hidden within the text.
